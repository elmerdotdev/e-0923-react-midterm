2. Choose an API that your team likes to use. Please choose only free ones
3. Design and code a web application that makes use of the API
4. Your application should have at least 3 working pages and an additional Not Found/404 page. Use routes to create the pages
5. Use React-Bootstrap to create the layout
6. Once you are done working with a branch, create a pull request from that branch to **dev**
7. For the final submission, make sure to create a pull request from dev to master
